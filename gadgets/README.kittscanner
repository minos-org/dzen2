========================================

This is just a fun gadget and wants to show what can be done with dzen
other than just displaying text ;).

It implements sort of a KITT (Knight Rider, TV series) scanner in shell
script.

There are some settings that you can tweak to your likings, see
"kittscanner.sh" for further details.
